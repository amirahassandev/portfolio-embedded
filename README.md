# 🔌 Embedded Systems Portfolio – Amira Hassan

Welcome to my Embedded Systems portfolio!  
I specialize in low-level programming, hardware-software integration, and real-time embedded development using **PIC microcontrollers**.

## 🔧 Core Skills

- Motor control systems (DC/Stepper/Servo)
- LCD interfacing (character & graphic displays)
- Digital input/output handling (buttons, LEDs, sensors)

## ⚙️ Hardware Modules & Interfaces

I work extensively with:

- **ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter)**
- **Timers 0 to 3** (PWM, delays, event capture)
- **CCP (Capture/Compare/PWM)**
- **EUSART** (Serial communication)
- **SPI & I2C** (Interfacing with sensors and modules)

## 🧠 What I Do

I write clean, well-documented C code for microcontroller-based systems, focusing on:
- Performance optimization
- Power efficiency
- Modularity and reuse
- Real-time response and debugging

## 📂 Sample Projects

- Motor speed control with feedback (PWM + ADC)
- LCD menu system with button navigation
- Temperature sensor interface via I2C
- Serial-based device monitoring over EUSART
